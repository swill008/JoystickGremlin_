# Button Map Editor — Help

Same text as **Help → Editor help** (F1) on the VKB-joystick-Button-Map window.

Device: VKBsim Gladiator EVO R. Save target: `control.hardware` (`qml/maps/vkb_evo_r.json`).

## Overview

Button Map is a photo of the stick with chips on the hardware contacts. **File → Edit Mapping** starts a session. The live window uses the same layout; pressing the stick still lights the matching chip. Layout does not change bindings.

**File → Save** writes the profile and becomes the live map. **File → Cancel** drops the session. Closing with unsaved work asks first.

## File

| Command | Function |
|---|---|
| Edit Mapping | Start the editor session |
| Save | Write `control.hardware` and the live map |
| Cancel | Leave without writing |
| Reset layout | Send every chip back to the reservoir. Inputs still illuminate |
| Choose background… | Pick a photo under the map |
| Clear image | Restore the stock rig photo |
| Exit | Close the window. Unsaved work still warns |

## Edit menu

| Command | Function |
|---|---|
| Undo / Redo | Layout history for this session (Ctrl+Z / Ctrl+Y) |
| Duplicate | Copy the selection, offset so it does not stack (Ctrl+D) |
| Copy / Paste | Clipboard of chips, groups, and frames (Ctrl+C / Ctrl+V) |

## View, zoom, pan

- Scroll wheel zooms about 50%–400%. Middle-button drag pans.
- **View → Reset view** returns 100% and centered.
- A resize or photo reload keeps a valid zoom. It only recenters when zoom or pan is broken.
- **View → Grid → Show grid** — overlay. Saved with the map.
- **Snap to grid** — drag onto grid points. Size 4 / 8 / 16 / 32.
- **Snap to entities** — snap to other chips, hots, frames.
- **Alt** while dragging skips snap.

## Reservoir

The pool lists chips not on the map. Filter by friendly or hardware name. X or Reset clears the filter.

Drag a chip from the pool onto the photo to place it. Resize the pool; the map does not zoom while the pointer is over the pool.

Empty photo right-click is **Draw** only — chips come from the pool.

## Chips

Left-drag moves the chip. The hotspot (dot on the photo) is the hardware contact — drag it separately.

**Right-click → Chip**

| Item | Function |
|---|---|
| Rename | Friendly label. Empty name falls back to the hardware / system name |
| Font size | Label size |
| Size / Round / Square / Filled / Hollow | Chip body |
| Fill… / Outline… / Text… | Idle colors (HSV picker) |
| Pressed fill / outline / text | Live highlight colors |
| Highlight on press | Live fill when the stick is down |
| Reset this cell | Drop member style overrides (Edit group only) |
| Delete chip | Return to the reservoir |

Delete / Backspace on a single chip also returns it to the pool. Yellow ring is selection.

Hotspot (photo input) and Leader End (wire stop) are first-level menus, not under Chip.

## Hotspot

Hotspot is the input on the photo — the control you press — not the chip label.

| Item | Function |
|---|---|
| Size | Dot diameter |
| Round / Square | Dot shape |
| Filled / Hollow | Dot fill |
| Color… | HSV picker for the photo dot only |

## Leader End

Leader End is where the wire stops. It is not the hotspot fill.

| Item | Function |
|---|---|
| Detach chip end | Free the terminus on the pill |
| Detach hotspot end | Free the terminus on the photo |
| Reconnect to this chip | Snap the chip-side end back |
| Reconnect to this hotspot | Snap the photo-side end back |

Leader still owns line color, weight, extra leaders, and curve.

## Groups

Shift-click or rubber-band two or more chips, then **Group → Group selected** (Ctrl+G). Extra leaders drop; one remains.

**Break group** (Ctrl+Shift+G) or Delete on a group splits members back to singles.

**Edit group** unlocks that group only. Other groups stay locked.

- Double-click or right-click a member to target it.
- Drag that member to offset it.
- Chip style writes to that member only.
- Double-click the member again to rename it.
- **Done editing group** or Esc ends the session.
- Double-click empty photo ends edit and clears the selection.

Saved group style profiles are not in yet. Each group keeps its own format and overrides.

## Format and Align

Format and Align are first-level drawers, not inside Group.

**Format → 5-Way** (five-member hat groups only)

| Theme | What it draws |
|---|---|
| Plus cluster | Up / Left / Push / Right / Down cross. Group name once. One leader |
| Mini hat | Compact U/D/L/R/C glyph |
| Named card | Header plus role-only rows |
| Radial leaders | Spokes from the group (can crowd three hats on this grip) |

Picking the theme that is already on **re-applies** it: stock layout, cell offsets and style overrides cleared, names kept.

**Clear Format** sits under Undo/Redo on a group click, and also in Format → Clear Format. It strips the 5-Way theme and every cell override (size, shape, colors, offsets). Names, Align, and the group stay. Enabled when a theme or any cell override exists.

**Align** left / center / right / Free layout — only when the target is a group.

Format is presentation. Hardware ids stay grouped. Save writes format to `control.hardware`.

## Context menu

The first screen follows the click target.

| Click | First screen |
|---|---|
| Group | Undo, Redo, Clear Format (theme or cell overrides), then Chip / Group / Format / Align / Leader / Draw |
| Leader or spine handle | Undo, Redo, Clear Format if the line belongs to a group, then Add spine, Convert spine, Delete selected spine, Clear spines, then the family drawers |
| Chip / group | Undo, Chip, Hotspot, Leader End, Group, Format, Align, Leader, Draw |
| Empty photo | Undo and Draw |

Gray items are gated: no selection, not a group, not a 5-way, or no spines.

## Leaders

A leader is the line from chip (or group) to the hotspot.

| Gesture | Function |
|---|---|
| Click the line | Select only. Does not add a spine |
| Drag a segment | Plant a **curved** spine at the grab point; the handle follows the drag |
| Click a handle | Select it (orange) |
| Short right-click on a handle | Menu. **Convert spine** flips curved ↔ straight (no check mark). **Delete selected spine** removes that handle |
| Hold right-click ~½ s on a handle | Delete that handle. No menu |

**First menu on a line or handle:** Add spine, Convert spine, Delete selected spine, Clear spines. Convert and Delete need a selected handle. Convert is a plain action — no check mark.

**Leader submenu:** Color…, Weight 0.8–4.0, Add straight / curved spine, This segment or All segments Curved / Straight, Add leader, Branch from this end, Attach (detach / reconnect chip or hotspot ends), Clear all spines, Delete spine, Delete leader.

Spines show only while Edit Mapping is on. The chip-to-hotspot line stays in the live map.

## Draw

**Right-click → Draw.**

- **Around selection** — rectangle, rounded, ellipse, triangle, or diamond around selected chips; it moves with them.
- **Free drag** — pick a shape, drag on empty photo. Shift locks aspect. Esc or Cancel tool drops the tool. Yellow **Drawing** in the toolbar means a tool is armed.
- Corner handles resize. Detach from chips turns an around-frame into a free frame.
- Shape, Padding, Rotate (0/90/180/270, ±15), Filled / Hollow, Fill color…, Stroke color…, Stroke width, Opacity.
- Bring forward / Send back. Hollow frames click through to chips inside.

## Select and move

Click selects. Shift-click or Ctrl-click toggles. Drag empty glass to rubber-band.

Arrows nudge 1 px. Shift+arrows nudge by the grid size.

## Save and live map

Save writes `kind: control.hardware` for **VKBsim Gladiator EVO R**. Nodes, image path, and `ui` (grid) go to the hardware profile.

The live face rebinds dest labels from pairing / vJoy / Xbox the same way as before. Theme and chip names are layout only.

Hardware ids on this grip stay locked (buttons 1–29, hat 1, axes 1–4). See `qml/vkb_evo_r_face_map.md` for JPEG pixel lock.
